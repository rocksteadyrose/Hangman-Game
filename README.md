DEPLOYED PROJECT LINK: https://rocksteadyrose.github.io/Hangman-Game/

The curtain's up and the lights are low - time for your fav show: Broadway Hangman!

Type a letter to guess the broadway song
Guesses Remaining displays your guesses remaining per song
Letters Already Guessed shows the letters (not in the word) that you've already guessed for the song
Wins shows how many songs you've guessed correctly

Turn your sound up to hear the music after you guess each song
See what happens if you win - or if you lose and are finished playing!
